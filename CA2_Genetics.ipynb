    "<b>1-Method For Selecting Mating Pool:</b> We considered two options for this: rank based and fitness based approach. both were implemented and tested and rank based approach got better results, so it was choosen. rank based approach ranks the chromosomes by their ranks and chooses their weight based on their ranks. Lowest rank has weight 1 and highest rank has weight len(population)\n",

    "Crossover: It is used to create new genes from old ones until the desired solution is reached, the method for this was explained in part4. This event is most likely to occure because it is the key to reach the solution. In this example, the chance of crossover happening is 95%. This number was determined by trial and error, other candidates were 90% and 85%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mutation: It takes a chromosome as input and changes its genes with probability of PM. Sometimes the desired solution cannot be obtained from the current genes, so this function helps by changing the genes and creating new ones. It also can help if the algorithm is stuck at some local minimum. however, the chances of crossover happening is low because it would interfer with main genetic algorithm and made it a totally random algorithm and the algorithm wont converge if mutation was more likely to happen. In this algorithm, the chance of mutation happening is 10%. Same as crossover, this number was determined by trial and error, other candidates were 5% and 1%.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4-Problems with Genetic Algorithm:</b> It is possible for the algorithm to get stuck at local maximum and it can cause a problem if local minimum is not enough to satisfy our need (like in sudoku problem). One way to fix this is to increase the mutation rate from the start(although it has its own setbacks as mentioned in above parts), or define a function to recognize local maximum.(like detecting the repeatation of the same value) and increase the mutation rate in this case. another way is to increase population or the number of times the algorithm runs, another way is to change the definition of fitness function or change mating pool selection method,. In general due to random nature of this algorithm, it is possible to face this problem regardless of our choise of method, sometimes runing the algorithm several times can help."
